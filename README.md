This directory contains **rendered CSS**, **compiled HTML** and all **assets**
like images and fonts. Do not edit HTML or CSS there because they become
overriden on next run of `fronthack watch` command. The directory is ready to
hosting on production server. It stores all assets and compiled code that is
needed to browse HTML pages located inside.



Repository was created only to temporary host the website.
