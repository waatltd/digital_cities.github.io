      <p>The biggest digital opportunity for Europe is in the transformation of its existing industry and enterprises. This requires industry in Europe to modernise through increased uptake of advanced technologies, new business models and service innovation in order to deliver innovative, high value-added products, processes and services.</p>

      <p>Digital Cities is launched by the European Commission to help ignite industrial modernisation across Europe from the bottom up. The initiative will take 15 cities through a tailored program of coaching and facilitation to develop and implement policies that will accelerate their progress on the digitalisation scale and allow them to take full advantage of the 4th industrial revolution.</p>

      <p>Participants will be supported to accelerate the transformation of their city by fostering digital talents and entrepreneurs, improving urban quality of life and wellbeing, making their cities greener and smarter, and creating a culture of innovation. </p>
