This folder is a core of SMACSS and BEM methodology. Sass files become compiled
to output CSS file located in `dist` and are separated into following folders:

* `base` - styling of basic HTML elements like typography, tables, forms etc.
* `components` - Fronthack components library
* `layout` - page sections styling - backgrounds and paddings etc.
